# Film Inquiry Slot Tagging

This project implements an long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to produce IOB slot tags for user-entered film inquiries using PyTorch. This project was completed as part of my coursework as a master's student of UCSC's Natural Language Processing program.
