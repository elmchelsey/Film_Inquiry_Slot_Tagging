# Film Inquiry Slot Tagging

This project implements an long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to produce IOB slot tags for user-entered film inquiries using PyTorch. This project was completed as part of my coursework as a master's student of UCSC's Natural Language Processing program. 

This coursework challenged students to apply slot tagging and various methods for addressing class imbalance. The report submitted alongside the project code can be found in ```slot_tagging.pdf```.
